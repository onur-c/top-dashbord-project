                As an alternative theory, (and because Latin scholars do this
                sort of thing) someone tracked down a 1914 Latin edition of De
                Finibus which challenges McClintock's 15th century claims and
                suggests that the dawn of lorem ipsum was as recent as the 20th
                century. The 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition ran out of room
                on page 34 for the Latin phrase “dolorem ipsum” (sorrow in
                itself). Thus, the truncated phrase leaves one page dangling
                with “do-”, while another begins with the now ubiquitous “lorem
                ipsum”.

                What I find remarkable is that this text has been the industry's
                standard dummy text ever since some printer in the 1500s took a
                galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book; it
                has survived not only four centuries of letter-by-letter
                resetting but even the leap into electronic typesetting,
                essentially unchanged except for an occasional 'ing' or 'y'
                thrown in. It's ironic that when the then-understood Latin was
                scrambled, it became as incomprehensible as Greek; the phrase
                'it's Greek to me' and 'greeking' have common semantic roots!”
                (The editors published his letter in a correction headlined
                “Lorem Oopsum”)

                And anyways, as Cecil Adams reasoned, “[Do you really] think
                graphic arts supply houses were hiring classics scholars in the
                1960s?” Perhaps. But it seems reasonable to imagine that there
                was a version in use far before the age of Letraset.

                So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According
                to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part
                of Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to
                mockup various fonts for a type specimen book. It's difficult to
                find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it
                popular as a dummy text in the 1960s, although McClintock says
                he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of
                old metal type samples. So far he hasn't relocated where he once
                saw the passage, but the popularity of Cicero in the 15th
                century supports the theory that the filler text has been used
                for centuries.

                Lorem ipsum began as scrambled, nonsensical Latin derived from
                Cicero's 1st-century BC text De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum.

                The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s
                when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again
                during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their
                software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates,
                websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own,

                The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block
                of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract
                from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out
                pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the
                focus is meant to be on design, not content.

                et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins
